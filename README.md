# Fibonacci Computation Application

This is a simple application that computes the n-th Fibonacci number based on user input. It uses OpenTelemetry to trace and monitor the application's performance.

## Getting Started

To run the application, you need to have Go installed on your machine. Then, you can clone the repository and run the following command:

```
go run main.go
```

This will start the application and prompt you to enter the n-th Fibonacci number you want to compute.

## Dependencies

The application uses the following dependencies:

- `go.opentelemetry.io/otel`: OpenTelemetry tracing and monitoring library
- `google.golang.org/grpc/credentials`: gRPC credentials for secure communication
- `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace`: OpenTelemetry exporter for tracing data
- `go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace/otlptracegrpc`: OpenTelemetry exporter for tracing data over gRPC


## Metrics Export

The application exports metrics to Signoz, a cloud-native observability platform. You can view the metrics in the Signoz dashboard to monitor the performance of the application. To install Signoz using docker, you can follow the instructions provided in the [Signoz documentation](https://signoz.io/docs/install/docker/). Signoz can also be replaced with any OpenTelemetry compatible service.
